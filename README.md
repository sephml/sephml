- I'm a post-graduate student at Queen Mary university London.
- I enjoy developing open source software to improve the accessibility and
  really passionate about machine learning methods.
- are you looking for open source software for _targeted_ causal machine
  learning? check out the [`tlverse` project](https://github.com/tlverse) and
  [its handbook](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook)!
- if we have shared interests and you'd like to chat about them, feel free to
  ping me [on telegram](@sepaminian) or consider just
